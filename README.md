# PatchEcoSim
### Ecological simulation in 3D of a piece of terrain
The aim of this project is to make an animated simulation of the 
ecological network happening in a place. There are lot of scientific
methods for achieveng great mimicking of the real world so, instead, 
this project focuses on making the simulation visually attractive 
while taking some of the ideas and information from those projects.
